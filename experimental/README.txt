Lab #4 - COMP120: Web Programming and Engineering
Nathan Wang
Due 6/9/2021

Due to a preexisting personal portfolio/website occupying natewang36.github.io, an experimental folder (named 'experimental') has been created. This folder contains the 3 html files (index, bio, resume) as well as all supporting CSS files, images, and fonts.

All aspects of the assignment were completed. The only parts I am not currently satisfied with are the emptiness of the index page (I may add an image slideshow or more links) and the inability for me to utilize multiple text decorations (underline, bold, italics) within the same line of text on the resume.

This lab was completed in roughly 4 hours.
