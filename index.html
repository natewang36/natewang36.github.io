         <h5>Senior Design Project: Medication Adherence Device - Fall 2022</h5>
         <div id="descriptioncontainer">
           <h6>For my senior design project, I worked with two teammates to develop a prototype for <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/elemed/" target="_blank">EleMed</a>, a small Tufts-based medical research group.
            In the US, around 75% of the 50+ population take prescription medication. However, around half of these consumers experience difficulty adhering to their daily medication. 
            This may be due to various reasons, such as bad memory, medical illiteracy, or a lack of a consistent schedule. 
            To combat this issue, EleMed is looking to develop a routine-based alert system that triggers when consumers go through a certain part of their daily routine, 
            such as brewing coffee or brushing teeth. This system is meant to be flexible enough to suit various routines for different consumers.
            <br><br>
            Our final prototype consisted of a two-part system: the first part was a sensor that would detect a user performing a part of their daily routine, such as brushing their teeth or brewing coffee. 
            This sensor module would then send a signal through a web server. 
            The second part of the system, a pill case dock, would then sound an alert that would only turn off once the user has removed the pill case from the dock and takes their pills. 
            <br><br>The video below provides a 2-minute overview of the project, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ORiCyzOo8LJcoOow1Xppz-tQDBO6aSkHLm7W_C1EqWM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">presentation slides can be found here</a>.

          <div id="descriptioncontainer">
            <h6>The final project for Robotics was to create a pair of robotic arms that would allow for users to transmit force from one to the other. Moving one arm would move the other, but if one arm encountered resistance (such as an object being placed in its path), the user holding the other arm would feel the resistance.
              <br><br>This was done using integral controls to determine the force necessary to rebound to the position determined by the encoders. The further the arm was from where it was supposed to be (determined by the position of the other arm), the more force the motor would exert to correct it.

            <h6>The second project for Robotics was to create a counterweighted robot with 3 degrees of freedom. The project was broken into 3 parts, each to be made by a member of the 3-person team. I was tasked with fabricating the dual motor mount. This motor mount was meant to manipulate the control arms of a 4-bar linkage around one axle, while providing a 5:1 mechanical advantage without any deadzones or cogging caused by gears. This was done using a belt-pulley system using high-tension elastic bands, as well as a screw-based tensioning system to tension the band.<br><br>The project was ultimately abandoned due to time constraints, but I managed to get my 4-bar linkage working with 8mm drone motors and an Arduino MKR motor shield. Below are some images of my motor mount (green and white parts) mounted on a rotating base plate made by a teammate (gray).</h6>

            <h6>The first assignment of the Tufts ME Senior Design course was to create a wooden shelf. This was a way for us to learn to use the powertools available in the NOLOP and Bray Labs. My shelf is designed to be mounted on a wall, and has walls to prevent any items from falling off. I sketched up my dimensions and cut the 6.5"x48" board accordingly. The L-brackets were all using the miter saw and attached using countersunked wood screws. The large wall (part 3) was the hardest cut to make, as I had to cut down the length of 3 feet of wood at 45 degrees using a handheld Japanese saw. However, after sanding down the cut, it was able to fit into the rest of the shelf without any issues.</h6>

My group designed and fabricated a robot that would theoretically use drone motors to press itself against a wall and climb vertically (like a spider). While we could not get it to work within the time assigned, it was an interesting concept to test.

    I grew up in Taipei, Taiwan, and matriculated into Phillips Academy Andover in Massachusetts in 2015.
    <br>
    I spent my freshman year at <a href="https://www.haverford.edu/ target="_blank"">Haverford College</a> pursuing a degree in Physics, but successfully transferred to the Tufts University School of Engineering as a rising sophomore.
    <br>
    At Tufts, I am double majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Human Factors Engineering. I find human robot interactions extremely interesting and am currently undertaking projects in that area.
